# disks
A simulation made using `p5.js` to demonstrate Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, using the example of hard disks in a fixed space. This was the initial problem for which the Metropolis algorithm was developed: a variant on this algorithm is used in this simulation.

You can find the simulation [here](https://rmears.github.io/disks/harddisks/).
